üìÅ Backups

If pihole-FTL sqlite3 is available, backup artifacts will be saved to:

`/var/backups/pihole_backup_<timestamp>/`

This directory contains:

- `pihole_backup.tar.gz` ‚Äì compressed snapshot of `/etc/pihole`
- `adlist.sql` ‚Äì Gravity adlist dump via `pihole-FTL sqlite3`
- `ftl_schema.sql` ‚Äì FTL schema export via `pihole-FTL sqlite3`

Backups will be skipped if write permissions are missing or if the backup directory cannot be created.
