## üìú Changelog

### v5.1.2
- **New backup destination**: `/var/backups/pihole_backup_<timestamp>/` stores each run in its own directory

- **FTL schema dump** now included alongside the Gravity backup for easier inspection

### v5.0
- **Step-by-step flow** with colored status output
- **Full logging** to `/var/log/pihole_maintenance_pro_<timestamp>.log`
- **Native backups** via Pi-hole's bundled SQLite interface for Gravity tables (v5.0 exported both `adlist` and `domainlist`)
- **Extra stats**: Top domains & top clients
- **Extra Raspberry Pi health info**: uptime, temperature, resource usage
- **Cron-ready**: OS/Pi-hole updates, gravity refresh, DNS reload, ping/dig/port checks
- **Backup location**: `/etc/pihole/backup_v6/` (legacy path, replaced by timestamped directories in v5.1.2)

## üîß Usage

Run the script with `sudo` or as root:

```bash
wget -O pihole_maintenance_pro.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TimInTech/pihole-maintenance-pro/main/pihole_maintenance_pro.sh && \
chmod +x pihole_maintenance_pro.sh && \
sudo ./pihole_maintenance_pro.sh
```

üìÅ Backups

If the `sqlite3` CLI is available (Pi-hole ships one via `pihole-FTL sqlite3`), backup artifacts will be saved to:

`/var/backups/pihole_backup_<timestamp>/`

This directory contains:

- `pihole_backup.tar.gz` ‚Äì compressed snapshot of `/etc/pihole`
- `adlist.sql` ‚Äì Gravity adlist dump captured with `sqlite3` (5-second lock timeout)
- `ftl_schema.sql` ‚Äì FTL schema export captured with `sqlite3` (5-second lock timeout)

Backups will be skipped if write permissions are missing or if the backup directory cannot be created.
